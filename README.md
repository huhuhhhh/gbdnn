# Deep Learning for accurate predictions of Grain Boundary (GB) Diagrams

This repo contains the data and code for our recent work:

C. Hu, Y. Zuo, C. Chen, S. Ong, J. Luo, Genetic algorithm-guided deep learning of grain boundary diagrams: Addressing the challenge of five degrees of freedom, Materials Today, Volume 38, September 2020, Pages 49-57.

This repo provides three single-task deep neural networks to predict three GB properties as a function of five crystallographic degrees of freedom (DOFs):

* Impurities or solutes adsorption (*a.k.a* segregation) at GB, e.g., GB excess of Ag at Cu GBs *Γ*<sub>Ag</sub>;

* Free volume of GB, *V*<sub>Free</sub>;

* GB Excess of structural disorder, *Γ*<sub>Disorder</sub>.

We have demonstrated the success of deep learning models in the construction of 
"complexion diagrams" of GB, the presence of GB property diagrams as functions of 
temperature and bulk composition.
